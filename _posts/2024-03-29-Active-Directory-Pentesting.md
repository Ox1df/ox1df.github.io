Hey pentesters! How's everyone doing? I've just started learning about AD pentesting, and I'll be sharing my journey and what I learn here. Today, let's start with the basics: What exactly is Active Directory?
# Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoftâ€™s directory and identity management service for Windows domain networks. It was introduced in Windows 2000, is included with most MS Windows Server operating systems, and is used by a variety of Microsoft solutions like Exchange Server and SharePoint Server, as well as third-party applications and services.

got stucked ??? :0

let me help 

Assume Active Directory (AD) is like a big phone book for computers in a company or organization. It keeps track of all the users, computers, printers, and other devices connected to a network.

Imagine you work in a big office building. Active Directory is like the receptionist who knows where everyone and everything is located. When you need to log in to your computer, access a file, or print a document, Active Directory helps make sure you have the right permissions to do so. It's basically a central hub that manages and controls everything that happens on the network, making it easier for administrators to keep things running smoothly and securely.
